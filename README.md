# DevTools
 cmd-line tools written in python to make development in Progress ABL easier. 


I created this set of cmd-line tooling in python to automate a lot of tasks in Progress ABL. Like when i want to have i dynamic dataset handle and appoint all the temp-table handles to the correct handles i run a script in this toolset, enter the name of the dataset and the Progress ABL code is generated automatically.
This Toolset also has scripts for method call mapping (which method calls which methods etc.) and a lot of automation for Progress coding i wanted.
